# E-Commerce FST

E-Commerce FST is a full-stack e-commerce application designed to provide a complete online shopping experience. The project features a robust backend API and a dynamic frontend interface to manage products, user accounts, shopping carts, and orders.


## Project Overview

This repository contains both backend and frontend code for the e-commerce application. The backend (built with Node.js and Express) provides RESTful API endpoints for product management, user authentication, and order processing. The frontend (built using a modern JavaScript framework) offers a responsive interface for browsing products, managing the shopping cart, and completing purchases.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login with encrypted passwords.
- **Product Management:** Browse and search through detailed product listings.
- **Shopping Cart:** Add, update, and remove items from a dynamically updated cart.
- **Checkout Process:** Seamless checkout with integration for payment processing.
- **Admin Panel:** Dedicated dashboard for administrators to manage products, orders, and user accounts.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express for building a RESTful API
- **Database:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL (depending on your configuration)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for secure sessions
